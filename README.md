# Project: Etch-a-Sketch
This is the fourth project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.   
   
The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).   
   
The demo page is [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).   
   
      
In this project, I was able to practice various DOM manipulation methods and event listeners.   
Also, I was also able to gain knowledge about event delegation, bubbling, and capturing.   

Lastly, while working on the project, I have also tried to use the best practice for writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
